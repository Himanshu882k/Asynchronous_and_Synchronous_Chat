# Asynchronous-and-Synchronous-Chat
Asynchronous and Synchronous Messaging app using sockets
📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how real-time chat systems can be implemented using Python’s socket programming in both synchronous (threaded) and asynchronous (asyncio) modes.
It enables multiple clients to connect to a single server over a local network (LAN) and exchange messages — just like a basic chatroom.
The goal is to show how both blocking (multi-threaded) and non-blocking (async) architectures can be used to build scalable messaging systems.

⚙️ Features
💬 Multi-client support (several users can chat at once)
🌐 Works over LAN (Wi-Fi router network)
🧵 Two different architectures:
Synchronous: Uses threads to handle each client
Asynchronous: Uses asyncio for event-driven concurrency

🚫 Handles client disconnections gracefully
🔁 Broadcast system (messages from one user are shared with all)
🧠 Simple chatbot echo logic included in the server
🧱 Architecture Overview
🧵 Synchronous (Threaded) Version
Uses socket + threading
Each client connection runs in its own thread
The main server thread listens for incoming connections
Suitable for smaller apps with limited users

Flow:
Server starts → listens on a port (e.g., 65432)
Client connects → server spawns a new thread
Each client thread waits for messages and broadcasts them
Server handles multiple clients concurrently

Pros:
Easy to understand
Simple debugging
Cons:
Each client uses a separate thread (memory heavy for large scale)

⚡ Asynchronous (AsyncIO) Version
Uses Python’s asyncio library
No threads; uses a single event loop for all clients
Non-blocking I/O: the server can handle thousands of connections efficiently

Flow:
Server starts using asyncio.start_server()
Each connection handled as a coroutine
Messages are received and broadcast without blocking others
The same event loop keeps all clients active simultaneously

Pros:
High scalability
Very lightweight on resources
Perfect for real-time systems (like chat, games, IoT, etc.)

Cons:
Slightly complex to implement and debug

🧠 How It Works (Both Versions)
Server:
Binds to an IP (like 192.168.x.x) and port (e.g., 65432)
Accepts connections from multiple clients
For every message from a client:
Sends a response to the sender
Broadcasts it to all other connected clients

Client:
Connects to the server using its IP and port
Sends messages typed by the user
Displays messages received from the server

Router Connectivity:
Works when devices (PC, phone, etc.) are on the same Wi-Fi
The server runs on the local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.34)
Clients use that IP to connect to the chatroom
